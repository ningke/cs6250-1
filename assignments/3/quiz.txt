See the cwnd plot for N = 1. Why is the "additive increase" part of
the sawtooth line curved and not straight?

A. Data variance from time to time, should be straight.

B. It is called “slow-start”, and it is also known as the exponential
growth phase, TCP congestion window is increased by the number of ACK
received. C. For that part, TCP congestion window is increased by one
every round. -- IT IS THE CONGESTION AVOIDANCE PHASE, NOT SLOW START
(WHICH IS ACTUALLY EXPONENTIAL)

D. It is known as the linear growth phase

E. None of above -- LEAST INCORRECT

Now, see the cwnd plots for other values of N. As N increases, should
the cumulative cwnd sawtooth show higher or lower variance? Why?

A. Lower variance, it is easier to assign bandwidth equally to more
TCP flows. -- KINDA-FALSE

B. Higher variance, it is more difficult to assign bandwidth equally
to more TCP flows. -- FALSE

C. Higher variance, for about tens of TCP flows, usually they are
synchronized, therefore high variance would be observed. -- FALSE

D. Lower variance, for about thousands of TCP flows, usually they are
synchronized, therefore lower variance would be observed. -- FALSE

E. None of above -- KINDA-FALSE

What should each host’s bandwidth share be for TCP flows?

A. Hosts should share bandwidth equally.

B. Host which starts TCP flow earlier would get more bandwidth.

C. Host which is near to the receiver would get more bandwidth.

D. Hosts would share bandwidth randomly.

E. None of above

=== 4 ===
If all hosts used UDP instead, what share would each host get?

A. They also should share bandwidth equally.

B. Half of them will share bandwidth equally, the other half will get
0 bandwidth.

C. They would share bandwidth randomly.

D. The first host starting UDP flow would get the total bandwidth.

E. None of above

=== 5 ===
If one of the hosts started more than 1 TCP flow to the receiver, how
would it affect other flows?

A. Nothing new would happen

B. Other flows would get 0 bandwidth, because one host tries to send
more than one TCP flow.

C. Other flows would get more bandwidth.

D. Bandwidth will be shared in this way, each flow would get its
bandwidth in this way: (total_bandwidth) / (total_number_of_tcp_flows)

E. None of above

=== 6 ===
What if that host used UDP instead of multiple TCP flows?

A. All hosts would get its share of total bandwidth equally.

B. TCP flows would have 0 bandwidth, UDP flow would get the total
bandwidth eventually.

C. UDP flows would get half of total bandwidth.

D. All hosts would get its share randomly.

E. None of above
