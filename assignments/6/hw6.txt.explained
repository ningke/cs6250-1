1. C ("As a result of the preponderance of small objects in large
       pages, web transfer latency has come to be dominated by both
       the round-trip time (RTT) between the client and server and the
       number of round trips required to transfer application data.")
2. C ("network bandwdith has grown substantially over the past two
       decades thereby significantly reduc- ing transmission delays")
3. D (B is accomplished by A, and probably the actual "goal")

4. A ("demonstrate that TCP's handshake is a key performance
       bot-tleneck for modern web transfers.")
5. D (cadb)
      c. Client sends a SYN packet to request both TCP connection and
         TFO cookie.
      a. Server encrypts the client IP to generate cookie.
      d. Client caches the TFO cookie for this particular serverâ€™s IP.
      b. Client sends a SYN packet to request a TCP connection under
         TFO along with data.

7. A ("At the core of TFO is a security cookie that is used by the

       connection.")
