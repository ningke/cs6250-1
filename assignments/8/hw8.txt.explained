1. Which of the following best describes DoS attack?
A - DoS attacks are an attempt to make a machine or network resource
    unavailable to its intended users.
B - DoS attacks can max out the processor's usage, preventing any work
    from occurring.
C - Both A and B

A is true AND a description of a DoS attack.  B is true, but a
description of a specific type of DoS attack (it is denial of service
to a resource, CPU is one example of a resource).  C is a better
description as a whole in that it includes a description AND an
example.
Final Answer: C



2. sFlow-RT is a real-time sFlow analytics engine for use in Software
   Defined Networking (SDN) stacks.  The sFlow engine works in the
   asynchronous way.
A - True
B - False

Final Answer: A



3. Which of the following best describes sFlow?
A - sFlow can be used for monitoring high-speed switched and routed
    networks.
B - sFlow is widely available in all classes of network equipment;
    from small department switches through to large 10G data center
    switches and routers.
C - sFlow offers greater scalability and reporting detail; providing
    detailed, real-time, L2-7 information on traffic throughout the
    network.
D - All of the above

A is a description of a capability of sflow, not sflow itself.  B is a
statement about sflow pulled from their marketing collateral.  C is
the same as B.  None of the options describe sflow.  A, B, and C are
either statements about it, or descriptions of some specific
capabilities.  D is probably the best answer.

Final Answer: D



4. Which of the following best describes PyResonance?
A - PyResonance is a Resonance platform implemented in Pyretic.
B - With PyResonance, multiple network policies can be built and
    composed together (sequentially or parallelly) as an overall
    network policy.
C - With PyResonance, multiple states can be built into each network
    policy.
D - All of the above

From the Resonance-SDN github wiki:
"PyResonance is a Resonance platform implemented in Pyretic."
A it is.

Final Answer: A



5. The Finite State Machine in this experiment has two states, “allow”
   and “block”.
A - True
B - False

Starting with the definition for "this experiment" as being step 5,
and the definition for "The Finite State Machine" being the FSM of the
system as a whole (as opposed to the DDoSFSM class/object/FSM), then
yes.  We either block the IP, or we don't.  We don't degrade service,
we don't throttle, we don't employ syn cookies, we don't filter on the
MAC, watch for smurfing, or anything else that's cool.  Let's go with
True.

Final Answer: A



6. Which of the following statement is correct?

A - Authentication policy is used in this experiment.
B - Intrusion Detection System policy is used in this experiment.
C - Both A and B

Using the same definition for "this experiment" from question 5, B.
Using the definition of "this experiemnt" as being the assignment as a
whole, C.  For the sake of consistency, let's go with B.

Final Answer: B
